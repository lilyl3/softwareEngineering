# Dorki: Study with Flashcards
Dorki is a simple flashcard study tool inspired by Quizlet and Anki, developed incrementally using agile methodologies to deliver an efficient and user-friendly learning tool.

## Features
1. Create and manage your own flashcard decks.
2. Track your progress with weekly reports showing the percentage of correct answers.

### Review Modes
Dorki offers two review modes:

1. Daily Mode:
Review all flashcards in a deck every day—great for quick refreshers.

2. Continuous Mode:
Flashcards are reviewed over time using a spaced repetition system (SRS).Each correct answer increases a flashcard’s level. Once a card reaches the maximum level (customizable), it's considered “burned” and won’t appear again in reviews.

## Getting Started
To run the app:

1. Install the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Open login.html, then click "Go Live" in the bottom-right corner of the editor.
